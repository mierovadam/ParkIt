# ParkIt

Android app for saving parking location with option to save a photo of the location without cluttering, and sharing this info with family or friends of your choice.
Usually without the app i personally would just take a screenshot of the map and delete it later or never...

I've tried to keep the app simple as possible otherwise it defeats the purpose of the app. (get out of the car and just hit a button or two)

### Outdoor parking:
That's the first screen you'll see once you're logged in.
Here you'll see your last saved location and you can swith to other "following" locations at the top.
(Usefull incase you share your car with someone in the family and dont have a pernament parking spot so the other can just see the location you've saved in order to find it)
You may add and view a picture you've taken of the car/surroundings. (each time you take a picture the previous one gets deleted in order to prevent cluttring and collect useless pictures).

### Indoor parking:
Here you can save information about parking location of the car if you've parked in an indoor parking lot.
You can take a picture without worrying about deleting it later, instead it will just be deleted if you hit "Clear" or if you just take a new picture of a new location.
Allso you can just type free description or just choose the available parameters of level,parking number and zone color.
